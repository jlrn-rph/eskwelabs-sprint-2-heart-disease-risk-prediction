# Sprint 2 Project: Healing the Heart and Mind: A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Heart Disease Health Indicators and Mental Health
This project is created by team **lockJAW**. We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our second sprint, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on the relationship of heart disease and mental health entitled **Healing the Heart and Mind: A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Heart Disease Health Indicators and Mental Health**. 
        
We focused on investigating the relationship between mental health and heart disease, as well as exploring the influence of various demographic variables, risk factors, health behaviors, and healthcare access on both mental health and heart disease. In addition, the study aimed to develop predictive models to determine the risk of heart disease based on mental health status and other risk factors. The ultimate goal was to provide recommendations for policymakers and healthcare providers on how to improve mental health and reduce the risk of heart disease. This study represents a critical step towards achieving SDG 3 and a healthier, happier future for all.

The project uses data from the CDC's 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, which is wrangled and analyzed using Python Pandas, exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithm using Gradient Boosting.

## Project Deployment
[Healing the Heart and Mind: A Heart Disase Risk Prediction App](https://lockjaw-heart-disease-risk-prediction.streamlit.app/)

## How to Run Locally
To run the code, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies in using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the application using the following command: `streamlit run app.py`.
5. The application will open in your browser.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the study found that men are more susceptible to heart disease, and identified several risk factors for heart disease including age, high blood pressure, history of stroke, smoking, history of diabetes, and difficulty walking. The study also revealed that depressive disorder is linked to an increased risk of heart disease. The findings highlight the importance of taking care of one's physical and mental health, as they are interrelated and can lead to complications and physical health diseases.
