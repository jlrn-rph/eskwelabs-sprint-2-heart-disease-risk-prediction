                    4. **Maintain a healthy weight**.  Excess weight can lead to conditions that increase the chances of developing heart disease â€” including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes.
                    5. **Get good quality sleep**. People who don't get enough sleep have a higher risk of obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes and depression.
                    6. **Manage stress**. Finding alternative ways to manage stress â€” such as physical activity, relaxation exercises or meditation â€” can help improve your health.
                    7. **Get regular health screenings**. High blood pressure and high cholesterol can damage the heart and blood vessels. But without testing for them, you probably won't know whether you have these conditions.

                    1. **Eat a healthy, balanced diet**. A low-fat, high-fibre diet is recommended, which should include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (5 portions a day) and whole grains.
                    2. **Be more physically active**. Regular exercise will make your heart and blood circulatory system more efficient, lower your cholesterol level, and also keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.
                    3. **Keep to a healthy weight**. A GP or practice nurse can tell you what your ideal weight is in relation to your height and build. 
                    4. **Give up smoking**. If you smoke, giving up will reduce your risk of developing a coronary heart disease.
                    5. **Reduce your alcohol consumption**
                    6. **Keep your blood pressure under control**. You can keep your blood pressure under control by eating a healthy diet low in saturated fat, exercising regularly and, if needed, taking medicine to lower your blood pressure.
                    7. **Keep your diabetes under control**. Being physically active and controlling your weight and blood pressure will help manage your blood sugar level.
                    8. **Take any prescribed medicine**. It's vital you take it and follow the correct dosage. Do not stop taking your medicine without consulting a doctor first, as doing so is likely to make your symptoms worse and put your health at risk.

        The study showed that men are more likely to experience heart disease as opposed to women. The factors that could increase the risk of heart disease are **age**, **high blood pressure**, **history of stroke**, **smoking**, **history of diabetes**, and **difficulty walking**.

        Also, we saw that having been diagnosed with depressive disorder in fact could lead to experiencing heart disease as well.

        From this, we see that it is important that each individual to take care of their health as most diseases are related to one another.

        Moreover, as much as we take care of physical health and well-being, people should also be mindful of their mental health as this could lead to complications and manifest as a physical health disease.

        Medical institutions across the globe can leverage on this study creating programs that would improve patient care.

        These are things institutions can consider are:
        * **Develop a personalized risk assessment tool**. While there are many risk factors for heart disease, each individual's risk profile is unique. Health institutions could develop a personalized risk assessment tool that takes into account a wide range of factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, and access to healthcare. This could help healthcare providers develop more targeted and effective treatment plans.
        * **Develop targeted cholesterol screening and documentation programs**, especially for high-risk populations such as those with a family history of heart disease or other risk factors. This can help identify and manage high cholesterol levels, which is a major risk factor for heart disease.
        * **Incorporate mental health services during checkups**. Incorporate mental health services into heart disease prevention programs, as depression and anxiety have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. This can include counseling services, stress reduction techniques, and mindfulness-based interventions.
        * **Implement a telemedicine program specifically for heart disease patients**. This could include regular check-ins with healthcare providers, remote monitoring of vital signs, and virtual support groups. Telemedicine could be particularly helpful for low-income individuals who may have difficulty accessing traditional healthcare services.

        We are the team **lockJAW**! We are a group of individuals from diverse backgrounds who came together as part of the Eskwelabs Data Science Cohort 11. In our second sprint, we collaborated to create a data-driven presentation on the relationship of heart disease and mental health entitled **Healing the Heart and Mind: A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Heart Disease Health Indicators and Mental Health**. 
        
        We focused on investigating the relationship between mental health and heart disease, as well as exploring the influence of various demographic variables, risk factors, health behaviors, and healthcare access on both mental health and heart disease. In addition, the study aimed to develop predictive models to determine the risk of heart disease based on mental health status and other risk factors. The ultimate goal was to provide recommendations for policymakers and healthcare providers on how to improve mental health and reduce the risk of heart disease. This study represents a critical step towards achieving SDG 3 and a healthier, happier future for all.

        The project uses data from the CDC's 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, which is wrangled and analyzed using Python Pandas, exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithm using Gradient Boosting.
